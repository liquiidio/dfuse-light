## Read-only Mode
#
# **Important**
# The dfuse Mindreader 'nodeos' process cannot be used as API node for transactions, it must not receive
# P2P transactions nor API transactions, that will create conflicts within 'nodeos' that will
# cause blocks to be mixed and will stop the dfuse for EOSIO process. It's also recommended to not use
# it for other API purposes even if it could work.
#
# If you require an API node, use dfuse Node Manager which is our 'nodeos' manager (dfuse Mindreader
# is actually a Node Manager with extra capabilities).
